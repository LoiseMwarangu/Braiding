      <li>A comb to smooth the hair as you work and to make clean sections
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Grab a section of your hair,use the comb to ensure it is neat and smooth</li>
       <li>Use your fingers to divide your hair into three sections.</li>
       <li> Position two of these sections in your left hand, and the third in the right hand. </li>
       <li>Move the section in your right hand over its neighbor, and swap which hands are holding them. The right section becomes the center section, and the former center section is now on the your right.</li>
